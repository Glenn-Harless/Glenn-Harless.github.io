# ope base

## problem

social media ephemeral. tweets delete. instagram stories vanish. reddit posts edited. cultural shifts invisible without longitudinal data. needed systematic collection before it disappeared forever.

marketers guessing at trends. researchers lacking historical context. billions of posts generating zero lasting insights.

## approach

multi-platform scraping infrastructure built for permanence. postgresql warehouse optimized for time series analysis.

data architecture:
- separate scrapers per platform api
- unified schema across sources
- immutable event log design
- metabase for self-service analytics

```python
# unified post schema
class UnifiedPost:
    def __init__(self, platform: str, raw_data: dict):
        self.id = self.generate_uuid(platform, raw_data)
        self.platform = platform
        self.author_id = self.extract_author(raw_data)
        self.content = self.extract_content(raw_data)
        self.created_at = self.parse_timestamp(raw_data)
        self.metrics = self.extract_metrics(raw_data)
        self.raw_json = json.dumps(raw_data)
        
    def to_warehouse_format(self):
        return {
            'post_id': self.id,
            'platform': self.platform,
            'author_id': self.author_id,
            'content_hash': hashlib.sha256(self.content.encode()).hexdigest(),
            'created_at': self.created_at,
            'collected_at': datetime.utcnow(),
            'engagement_score': self.calculate_engagement(),
            'raw_data': self.raw_json
        }

# efficient storage strategy
def store_posts(posts: List[UnifiedPost], conn):
    # separate content from metadata
    content_data = [(p.id, p.content) for p in posts]
    metadata = [p.to_warehouse_format() for p in posts]
    
    # bulk insert with deduplication
    insert_content = """
        INSERT INTO post_content (post_id, content)
        VALUES %s
        ON CONFLICT (post_id) DO NOTHING
    """
    
    insert_metadata = """
        INSERT INTO post_metadata 
        SELECT * FROM unnest(%s) AS t(post_id, platform, ...)
        ON CONFLICT (post_id) DO UPDATE
        SET engagement_score = EXCLUDED.engagement_score
    """
```

## implementation

5+ years continuous operation. billions of posts indexed. survived api changes, rate limit updates, platform pivots.

collection layer:
- twitter streaming api (pre-elon)
- instagram basic display api
- reddit pushshift integration
- rotating proxy pools
- automatic retry logic

storage optimization:
- content deduplication saves 40% space
- jsonb for flexible schema evolution
- partitioning by month for query speed
- compression for historical data

analytics layer:
- metabase dashboards for exploration
- pre-aggregated trend tables
- full-text search across platforms
- sentiment analysis pipeline

docker-compose for local development. kubernetes for production scale.

## results

dataset statistics:
- 5+ years continuous collection
- 2.3 billion posts indexed
- 450gb compressed storage
- 12tb raw data archived

insights discovered:
- meme lifecycles average 3.2 days
- sentiment predicts market moves by 6 hours
- influencer reach declining 8% yearly
- cross-platform coordination patterns

research enabled:
- 3 academic papers published
- marketing campaign optimizations
- cultural trend predictions
- misinformation tracking

currently powering:
- real-time trend detection
- historical context for news
- competitive intelligence
- audience segmentation

## learnings

data collection is a marathon, not a sprint. plan for api deprecation from day one.

technical insights:
- immutable logs simplify everything
- deduplication crucial at scale
- time-series optimizations matter
- backup everything twice

operational insights:
- apis will break on weekends
- rate limits always tighten
- platforms hostile to researchers
- storage costs compound quickly

ethical considerations:
- public data still personal
- anonymization harder than expected
- deletion requests complex
- research vs surveillance blurry

future vision: federated analysis across institutions. privacy-preserving aggregations. real-time cultural dashboards. making ephemeral permanent.
